# llmes — Low-Latency Matching & Execution Simulator

A C++20 simulator developed incrementally from correctness-first matching logic to later performance-focused redesigns.

**Current implementation scope: Phase 1 / Matching Core only.**

---

## Current Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Matching Core (Phase 1) | Done |
| Data structure | `std::map<price, std::list<Order>>` (price level + FIFO queue) |
| Order types | Limit / Market / Cancel |
| Trade output | `Trade` + `AddResult` |
| Failure-mode handling | pending-cancel, market remainder cancel, duplicate ID |
| Unit tests | rest / match / market sweep / pending cancel |
| Performance rewrite (Phase 2+) | Not started |
| Market Data / Execution / Risk | Not started |
| tslib / lfutils | Not started |

## What Is Implemented (Phase 1)

Baseline central limit order book:

- **Ask book:** ascending price; `begin()` = best ask
- **Bid book:** descending price; `begin()` = best bid
- **FIFO:** `std::list` per price level
- **API:** `add_limit_order`, `add_market_order`, `cancel_order`
- **Results:** `Trade`, `AddResult`, `ErrorCode`

### Entry points

- `core/matching_core/include/matching/order_book.hpp`
- `core/matching_core/src/order_book.cpp`
- `core/matching_core/tests/order_book_test.cpp`

---

## Build & Test

**Requirements:** CMake >= 3.20, C++20 (GCC 13+ or Clang 16+ recommended)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

If you see `No test configuration file found`, run `ctest` with `--test-dir build` (or `cd build` then `ctest`).

## Phase 1 Behavior

### Limit order

- Matches opposite side while price crosses.
- Remainder rests on the same side at limit price.
- FIFO within each price level.

### Market order

- Consumes opposite liquidity until filled or book empty.
- Unfilled remainder is not posted; returns `MarketRemainderCancelled`.

### Cancel

- Found on book -> removed, `Success`.
- Not found -> `UnknownOrderId`, id added to pending-cancel set.
- Later insert with same id -> `PendingCancelExists`.

### Time Complexity

#### Notation
- `N`: total number of resting orders in the book (bid + ask).
- `Pb` / `Pa`: number of price levels on bid / ask side.
- `P`: number of price levels on the side touched by this operation (use `max(Pb, Pa)` for an upper bound).
- `K`: number of maker orders actually visited/matched during this request.
Assumption: `std::unordered_set` operations are average-case `O(1)` under normal hash distribution.

#### Time Complexity (Phase 1 Implementation)
| Function | Time Complexity (average) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `OrderBook()` | `O(1)` | Empty container initialization |
| `pending_cancel_count()` | `O(1)` | `unordered_set::size()` |
| `cancel_order()` | `O(N)` | Linear scan across both books (`map` levels + `list` queues) |
| `add_limit_order()` | `O(K + log P)` | Match `K` makers; if remainder exists, insert into `map` level (`log P`) |
| `add_market_order()` | `O(K)` | Match only; no remainder posting |
| `can_cross_limit()` | `O(1)` | Single price comparison |
---


## Failure-Mode Coverage

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Cancel before insert | Pending cancel; later insert rejected |
| Duplicate order id | `DuplicateOrderId` |
| Market sweeps book | Partial fill; remainder cancelled |

## Design Notes

- Intentional minimal Phase 1 baseline (correctness first).
- Cancel scans price levels (expected for this phase).
- Later: intrusive list, id index, skip list, SoA, pmr, benchmarks.

---

## Roadmap

1. Phase 1 (current): functional core + tests
2. Phase 2: intrusive queue, O(1) cancel index, skip list
3. Phase 3: SoA, cache alignment, pmr experiments
4. Phase 4: perf / benchmark (p50/p99, LLC miss)
5. Market data, execution, risk, tslib, lfutils
