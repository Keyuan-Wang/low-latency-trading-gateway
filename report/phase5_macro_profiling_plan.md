# Phase 5 Macro Profiling Plan

## Context

Phase 4 ended with a corrected `hft_macro` benchmark and operation-level profiling. The important fix was removing measured-batch tracking drift: cancel and modify targets now come from live book state, so the macro workload no longer produces a large artificial `cancel_miss` population.

Phase 5 starts from the repaired `master` branch and focuses on profiling before making more data-structure changes.

## Latest Aligned Run

```

The run contains two aligned measurements:

- `latency`: wall-clock macro and per-operation latency.
- `pmc`: in-process perf counters around the measured benchmark window.

## Add-Rest Stage Profile

The `add_rest` path was then instrumented and profiled separately to move from operation-level attribution to function-level attribution.

Cloud run:

```

Sanity check:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| `add_rest` op count | 47851 |
| add-rest stage count | 47851 |
| `cancel_miss` | 0 |
| `modify_miss` | 0 |

Stage breakdown:

| Stage | Mean ns | Mean cycles | ns share | cycles share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `level_lookup` | 41.573 | 173.310 | 19.271% | 16.811% |
| `match` | 31.367 | 149.873 | 14.540% | 14.538% |
| `id_index_insert` | 30.707 | 146.900 | 14.234% | 14.249% |
| `validation` | 29.416 | 143.791 | 13.635% | 13.948% |
| `fifo_append` | 27.851 | 140.087 | 12.910% | 13.588% |
| `node_init` | 27.503 | 137.910 | 12.749% | 13.377% |
| `pool_acquire` | 27.314 | 139.065 | 12.661% | 13.489% |

This is profiling-mode data, so the absolute `add_rest` latency is inflated by instrumentation overhead. The useful signal is the relative split inside the add-rest path.

## Overall Result

| Mode | avg_ns | ops_s | cycles/op | instructions/op | CPI | branch miss rate | cache misses/op | ok |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `latency` | 103.934 | 9.62145e+06 | - | - | - | - | - | 199981 |
| `pmc` | - | - | 361.417 | 670.021 | 0.539411 | 0.0192954 | 0.07932 | 199989 |

The PMC result does not look memory-bound. `cache_misses_per_op = 0.07932`, which is roughly:

```text
0.07932 / 670.021 * 1000 = 0.118 cache misses per 1000 instructions
```

This is very low for a workload that would be dominated by LLC or DRAM misses. The current macro benchmark is more consistent with fixed instruction-path cost than with cache-miss latency.

## Operation-Level Result

The latency run gives the clearest weighted-cost picture:

| Operation | Share | Mean ns | p50 ns | p95 ns | p99 ns | Weighted time share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `add_rest` | 47.849% | 65.023 | 60 | 100 | 150 | 53.592% |
| `cancel_hit` | 46.159% | 43.507 | 40 | 60 | 60 | 34.592% |
| `modify_hit` | 3.929% | 117.144 | 100 | 220 | 290 | 7.928% |
| `market` | 1.597% | 119.105 | 80 | 250 | 410.4 | 3.276% |
| `add_cross` | 0.466% | 76.094 | 70 | 130 | 173.5 | 0.611% |
| `cancel_miss` | 0.000% | 0.000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000% |
| `modify_miss` | 0.000% | 0.000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000% |

The workload is now internally coherent:

- `cancel_miss = 0`
- `modify_miss = 0`
- `add_rest + add_cross ~= 48.3%`
- `cancel_hit ~= 46.2%`
- `market ~= 1.6%`

## Interpretation

### `add_rest` Is The Main Macro Cost Center

`add_rest` contributes more than half of measured macro time:

```text
47.849% event share * 65.023 ns mean = 53.592% weighted time share
```

It is not the slowest individual operation, but it is the highest-leverage path because it is hit on nearly half of all macro events.

In HFT terms, this is also the quote-placement path. Reducing `add_rest` latency can improve quote refresh speed and same-price FIFO positioning. That makes it more commercially relevant than optimizing rare market sweeps in the current workload.

### `cancel_hit` Is Important But Already Tight

`cancel_hit` is the second-largest weighted contributor, but its latency profile is already strong:

```text
mean = 43.507 ns
p50  = 40 ns
p95  = 60 ns
p99  = 60 ns
```

The current O(1) cancel path appears healthy. It should be protected during future changes, but the data does not point to cancel as the first optimization target.

### `modify_hit` Is Expensive But Low Share

`modify_hit` is more expensive than `add_rest` and `cancel_hit`, but its event share is only about 3.9%. Its weighted contribution is meaningful but secondary. This result is expected because modify is structurally close to cancel plus add.

### `market` Is Not The Current Bottleneck

Market orders are low-frequency and shallow in this workload:

```text
market share ~= 1.6%
market_levels_p99 = 2
market_filled_qty_p99 = 5
```

Optimizing deep market sweeps is unlikely to move this macro benchmark unless the workload model changes.

### Cache Locality Is Not The Leading Hypothesis

The low generic cache-miss rate weakens the hypothesis that macro performance is currently dominated by cache misses from poor order locality. This does not mean memory layout is irrelevant, but it does mean that the next optimization should not be based on cache-locality intuition alone.

The ChunkPool experiment was useful because it tested that intuition. The current profiling result suggests Phase 5 should instead identify which fixed steps inside `add_rest` consume cycles.

The function-level result confirms that `add_rest` is not dominated by a single call site. `level_lookup` is the largest measured stage, but it is only about 19% of the measured add-rest stage time. The rest of the path is spread across `match`, `id_index_insert`, `validation`, `fifo_append`, `node_init`, and `pool_acquire`.

## Cloud Profiling: level_lookup_existing vs level_create_new

The `get_or_create()` return type was changed from `PriceLevel&` to `std::pair<PriceLevel*, bool>`, using `try_emplace` instead of `operator[]`, to allow the profiling instrumentation to distinguish existing-level lookup from new-level creation. The `AddRestCallProfile` accumulates timing for whichever path was taken, then commits both to the global snapshot at the end of the `add_limit_order` call.

A cloud profiling run was executed with both `LLMES_PROFILE_HFT_MACRO_OPS=ON` and `LLMES_PROFILE_ADD_REST_STAGES=ON`.

### Operation-Level Result (profiling mode)

| Operation | Count | Share | Mean ns | Mean cycles | Weighted ns share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `add_rest` | 47,850 | 47.85% | 524.24 | 1,331.13 | **90.44%** |

| `market` | 1,591 | 1.59% | 117.11 | 353.21 | 0.67% |
| `add_cross` | 507 | 0.51% | 217.50 | 593.94 | 0.40% |

Note: profiling-mode absolute latencies are inflated by instrumentation overhead (`__rdtsc()` + `steady_clock::now()` per stage × 7). The production `add_rest` latency is ~35 ns; the profiling-mode measurement includes ~220 ns of stage-internal work plus ~304 ns of timing overhead. Only the relative proportions are meaningful.

### Add-Rest 8-Stage Breakdown

| Stage | Mean ns | Mean cycles | ns share | cycles share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `match` (含 can_cross) | 32.45 | 150.05 | 14.71% | 15.57% |
| `id_index_insert` | 30.86 | 147.03 | 13.99% | 15.25% |
| `validation` (3 checks) | 29.11 | 142.57 | 13.20% | 14.79% |
| `fifo_append` | 28.48 | 141.43 | 12.92% | 14.67% |
| `node_init` | 28.01 | 139.06 | 12.70% | 14.43% |
| `pool_acquire` | 27.66 | 138.94 | 12.54% | 14.41% |
| **`level_lookup_existing`** | **26.86** | **63.89** | **12.18%** | **6.63%** |
| **`level_lookup_create_new`** | **17.10** | **40.98** | **7.75%** | **4.25%** |

Note on `count` reporting: the current profiling accumulator unconditionally increments the `count` field for every stage slot on each `add_rest` call, so all 8 stages report `count = 47,850`. The `mean_ns` and `mean_cycles` columns are computed from `total_ns / count` and `total_cycles / count` in the emitter and should be read as average-cost-per-add_rest, not as average-cost-per-hit for the level_lookup stages. A future refinement should track per-stage hit counts separately. The `total_ns` and `total_cycles` columns are correct.

### Key Findings

#### 1. `std::map::try_emplace` is Not the Bottleneck

`level_lookup_existing` costs 63.89 cycles per add_rest — the **lowest cycle cost of any stage by a wide margin** (the next lowest is `pool_acquire` at 138.94 cycles). The `std::map` red-black tree lookup for an existing price level is well-optimized by the compiler and accounts for only 6.63% of add_rest cycle time. **Replacing `std::map` with a faster price-index structure (absl::btree_map, ring buffer, or flat hash map) would address at most ~6.6% of the add_rest cycle budget.**

This directly answers the question posed by the Phase 4 price-level storage strategy report: the ordered-map lookup is **not** the performance bottleneck for the dominant `add_rest` path in the HFT macro workload.

#### 2. No Single Stage Dominates — The Cost Is Distributed

The 7 stages (treating the two level_lookup variants as one path) each consume between 12.5% and 15.6% of add_rest cycles. The standard deviation across the 7 main stages is only ~4.8 cycles. This means:

- There is no "fix one slow function and win" opportunity.
- Any optimization that targets a single stage caps out at ~15% improvement on `add_rest`, which translates to ~8% on macro throughput (since `add_rest` is ~53% of weighted macro time).
- Real progress requires reducing fixed cost across the entire path: fewer total instructions, fewer branches, fewer store operations.

The ChunkPool experiment's failure makes sense in this light: it reduced allocation cost (pool_acquire) but added overhead to fifo_append (chunk linkage), id_index_insert (no change), and remove (chunk_from_order + link_available). The net effect was a ~12% regression because the distributed overhead increase outweighed the localized allocation improvement.

#### 3. `level_create_new` Is Rare In Steady State

In a warmed book with 100,000 orders across 100 price levels, nearly every price already has an active level. The `level_create_new` total cycles (1,961,018) are only ~39% of `level_lookup_existing` total cycles (3,057,094). Since both stages have the same inflated count, the ratio of actual hits is proportional to the total cycle ratio: **existing-level lookups outnumber new-level creations by roughly 2.5:1 in this workload.** The create path is too rare to be an optimization target — every effort should go into the existing-lookup hot path.

#### 4. Profiling-Mode Count Reporting Issue

The `RecordAddRestStageProfile` function unconditionally increments `stage.count` for every stage slot regardless of whether that stage accumulated non-zero ns/cycles. This means `count` and `mean_ns`/`mean_cycles` in the CSV output should be interpreted as "per-add_rest amortized cost," not "per-hit cost." The `total_ns` and `total_cycles` columns are unaffected. A future fix should make the ScopedAddRestStage increment count only for the specific stage it measures, and the level_lookup split should track separate hit counts.

## Revised Phase 5 Strategy

The profiling data narrows the optimization space decisively:

1. **The price-index container is not the binding constraint.** The `std::map` lookup for existing levels costs 63.89 cycles — the cheapest stage. This removes the urgency from the Phase 4 plan's V2 (absl::btree_map), V4 (hot ring), V5 (bitmap), and V6 (cold container experiments). Those changes would optimize a cost center that represents 6.6% of add_rest cycles.

2. **The bottleneck is distributed fixed cost.** The remaining ~93% of add_rest cycles is spread across validation, match, allocation, initialization, append, and index insertion — each 139–150 cycles. The optimization strategy should shift from "find the slow stage" to "reduce instruction count and branch density across the entire add path."

3. **Concrete next candidates:**
   - **Merge validation checks.** `pending_cancel_ids_.contains()` + `id_to_order_.contains()` + `quantity == 0` are three sequential branches. Combining them into a single early-return path with fewer mispredict opportunities could reduce validation cost.
   - **Eliminate redundant stores.** `node_init` aggregates 6 field assignments (`*node = {id, price, qty, ts, nullptr, nullptr}`). Some of these are overwritten by `fifo_append` (`prev`, `next`) or `pool_acquire` (`parent_level`). Reducing the store count by initializing only the business fields and letting the append/pool paths set their own metadata could save cycles.
   - **Inline `push_back`.** `fifo_append` costs 141.43 cycles for what is a simple 4-pointer linked-list append. The function call overhead on a non-inlined method may be material at this scale.
   - **Profile with `perf record` / `perf annotate` for instruction-level hotspots.** The stage breakdown is ~200 ns in profiling mode; a non-instrumented production-mode cycle-accurate profile via `perf` would show exact instruction retirement stalls.

4. **Do not pursue price-index replacement until a different workload demands it.** The current macro workload (47.85% add, 46.16% cancel, shallow market sweeps) does not stress the ordered map. A workload with deeper market sweeps, wider price ranges, or more level churn could change the conclusion. But for the current workload, the data is clear.

## Working Rule For Phase 5

Do not introduce another major storage redesign. The profiling data shows the distributed nature of the add_rest cost: the cheapest stage is the `std::map` lookup at 63.89 cycles, while six other stages each cost 139–150 cycles. The next change should be instruction-level optimization of the add path, guided by `perf annotate` rather than by structural intuition.

The level_lookup_existing vs level_create_new split is now recorded. The remaining instrumentation gap is per-stage hit counting (cosmetic fix to the profiling accumulator) and a production-mode `perf record` run for instruction-level attribution.

## Production `perf record` Run (Window-Isolated)

> **Status note:** the production `perf record` data below **supersedes** the "Revised Phase 5 Strategy" and "Working Rule" conclusions above. In particular, the earlier claim that the `std::map` price-level container is *not* a binding constraint was an artifact of the short (100k) instrumented batch. The production run changes that conclusion (see Finding 2).

### Why a Plain `perf record` Would Not Work

`bench_hft_macro`'s `Setup()` is heavy and runs on **every measured iteration**: ~5,000 seed adds, a 500,000-event warmup replay, two full book rebuilds (`build_book_from_tracking`), and complete batch pre-generation. A naive `perf record ./bench_hft_macro` would be dominated by this scaffolding (`generate_pending_one`, `build_book_from_tracking`, RNG, tracking maps), and `perf report` would bury the engine hot path.

To avoid this, a `perf record --control=fifo` window was added that mirrors the existing PMC enable/disable pattern. The runner (`benchmark_runner.cpp::PerfRecordControl`) enables sampling only around the measured `RunOp` batch — warmup, `Setup()`, and `Teardown()` run with sampling disabled. The helper is inert (zero overhead) unless the FIFO paths are provided via `LLMES_PERF_CTL_FIFO` / `LLMES_PERF_ACK_FIFO`. Driver script: `benchmark/scripts/run_hft_macro_perf_record.sh`.

The profiling binary is built **Release + `-g`, with no `LLMES_PROFILE_*` macros**, so the recorded code path is the exact production engine measured by the campaign — not an instrumented variant.

### Run Sanity

The control FIFO worked exactly as designed: `run.log` shows 40 paired `Events enabled` / `Events disabled` transitions (one per measured iteration), the latency line reports a clean **18.47M ops/s @ 54.1 ns/op** (no instrumentation overhead), and perf captured 30,354 samples (≈15K per event).

**Why `annotate_*.txt` is empty:** at `-O3` the entire engine is inlined into `BenchHftMacro::RunOp` (every frame in `report.txt` is marked `(inlined)`). There is no standalone `add_limit_order` / `cancel_order` symbol for `perf annotate --symbol=...` to match. The call-graph report still provides full function-level attribution via inlined frames. For true instruction-level annotation in a future run, annotate the containing symbol (`...RunOp`) or the out-of-line leaves (`std::_Rb_tree_insert_and_rebalance`, `operator new`, `std::_Rb_tree_rebalance_for_erase`, `malloc`/`cfree`).

### Function-Level Attribution (share of all `RunOp` samples)

| Function / sub-cost | cycles % | branch-miss % | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **`add_limit_order`** | **50.5%** | 50.4% | dominant op |
| ┣ `get_or_create` (**`std::map`**) | **17.8%** | **18.9%** | lower_bound 6.3% + new-node malloc/rebalance 8.9% |
| ┣ `contains` (id-index dup check) | **11.2%** | 10.6% | **redundant** with `emplace` |
| ┣ `emplace` (id-index insert) | 9.9% | 9.9% | `find_or_prepare_insert` |
| ┣ `erase_best` ×2 (drain emptied levels) | 4.6% | 4.5% | RB-tree rebalance + `cfree` |
| ┗ `push_back` / `acquire` / `node_init` | ~3% | ~3% | intrusive append, pool, init |
| **`cancel_order`** | **29.8%** | 29% | `find` 19.9% + `erase` 7.6% |
| **`modify_order`** | 8.0% | 8% | mostly its internal `add_limit_order` |
| `add_market_order` + remainder | ~8% | ~8% | shallow sweeps |

### Finding 1 — The Cancel-Index Hash Map (`id_to_order_`) Dominates

Summing `id_to_order_` (`absl::flat_hash_map`) work across all operations:

```text
add:    contains 11.2% + emplace 9.9% = 21.1%
cancel: find     19.9% + erase   7.6% = 27.6%
modify: ~3%
total:  ≈ 50% of all macro cycles
```

Roughly half of the entire macro workload is spent inside the cancel index. The cost is SIMD probing (`Match` / `_mm_cmpeq_epi8`), `PrefetchToLocalCache`, hashing, and `find_or_prepare_insert` — i.e. compute-bound probe work, which is consistent with the very low PMC cache-miss rate. The structure is doing its job (cancel p99 is 60 ns), so the lever is **reducing the number of probes**, not changing the table type.

**Redundant double-probe in `add_limit_order`.** The add path probes the same key in `id_to_order_` twice:

1. `contains(order_id)` — the duplicate-id guard (11.2% cycles). For `add_rest` this **always misses**.
2. `emplace(order_id, node)` — re-hashes and re-probes from scratch (9.9%).

Merging these into a single `lazy_emplace` / `find_or_prepare_insert` (check the insertion result instead of pre-checking) removes essentially the entire `contains` cost. This is the **highest-leverage, lowest-risk** change exposed by the profile: ~11% of total macro cycles and ~10% of branch-misses recoverable.

`pending_cancel_ids_.contains()` did **not** surface as a hotspot, confirming the set is effectively empty in steady state (`cancel_miss = 0`). Switching it to an empty-guard + `absl::flat_hash_set` is a free consistency cleanup, not a performance driver.

### Finding 2 — `std::map` Level Container Is *Not* Cheap In A Long Run

This **contradicts the earlier stage-profiling conclusion** (that `std::map` lookup is the cheapest stage at 63.89 cycles / 6.6% of add). In the production run, `get_or_create` is **35% of `add_limit_order`** (17.8% of all cycles) and the **single largest branch-miss source** in the engine:

| `get_or_create` sub-cost | cycles % | branch-miss % |
|---|---:|---:|
| `lower_bound` (RB-tree traversal) | 6.3% | 6.5% |
| `emplace_hint` new-node insert | 8.9% | 9.7% |
| ┣ `_Rb_tree_insert_and_rebalance` | 3.6% | 4.7% |
| ┗ `_M_create_node` → `operator new` → `malloc` | 3.8% | 3.6% |

Plus `erase_best` level deletion (4.6% cycles), which carries its own `_Rb_tree_rebalance_for_erase` (1.2%) and `cfree` (~0.8%).

**Why the contradiction?** The reconciliation is the workload length / level churn:

- The stage-profiling run used `batch_size = 100,000` against a pre-warmed 100k-order book. Almost every price level already existed, so the measured batch rarely created or destroyed levels — the malloc + rebalance path was effectively not exercised.
- The production `perf record` run used `batch_size = 1,000,000`. Over a long stream the best price drifts continuously, so price levels are **created and destroyed constantly**, exposing `operator new` / `malloc` / `cfree` churn and RB-tree rebalancing.

The corrected conclusion: **whether the price-level container matters depends on run length and level churn.** For a short, pre-warmed batch it is invisible; for a realistic long continuous HFT stream it is ~24% of cycles and the top branch-miss contributor. The low PMC cache-miss rate still holds — the std::map cost is branch-heavy RB-tree manipulation and allocator work, **not** memory stalls.

### Revised Optimization Plan (production-evidence-ranked)

**Tier 1 — Eliminate the `id_to_order_` double-probe (highest leverage, lowest risk).** Merge `contains` + `emplace` in `add_limit_order` into one `lazy_emplace` / `find_or_prepare_insert`. Recovers ~11% of macro cycles and ~10% of branch-misses. Also switch `pending_cancel_ids_` to an empty-guard + `absl::flat_hash_set` (free cleanup). Expected macro gain: ~+6–9%.

**Tier 2 — Attack `std::map` level churn (this re-opens the Phase 4 question).** The target is the create/destroy allocator + rebalance cost, not the lookup:

- **2a (safe, do first):** give `std::map` a pooled / free-list allocator so level create/destroy stops calling `operator new` / `malloc` / `cfree` (~5% cycles). Keeps `std::map` semantics and **pointer stability** (`Order::parent_level` stays valid). Low risk.
- **2b (structural, higher risk):** replace `std::map` with `absl::btree_map` or a hot contiguous structure. `btree_map` moves values on rebalance, which would invalidate `Order::parent_level` — the exact constraint flagged in the Phase 4 storage report. Requires changing the ownership model (e.g. heap-allocate `PriceLevel` and store `PriceLevel*` in the container) before it is correct. Defer until 2a is measured.

**Tier 3 — Leave the cancel `find` / `erase` (27.6%) alone.** This is `absl::flat_hash_map` doing necessary SIMD-probe work; cache misses are low and the cancel tail is already tight (p99 60 ns). No structural lever here without changing the index itself.

Combined Tier 1 + Tier 2a expected gain: ~+10–13% macro throughput. Crucially, this **breaks the "8% single-stage ceiling"** feared earlier, because these changes target *cross-cutting structural costs* (hash double-probe, allocator churn) rather than a single stage.

### Updated Working Rule For Phase 5

The earlier rule ("do not introduce another storage redesign; the price index is not the constraint") is **revised**. The production profile shows two clear, data-backed targets:

1. The redundant `id_to_order_` probe in the add path (structural, safe).
2. The `std::map` level-create/destroy allocator + rebalance churn under a long continuous stream (start with a pooled allocator, keep pointer stability).

The next code changes should be Tier 1 first, then Tier 2a, each validated with a 10-trial production PMC comparison (`instructions_per_op`, `branch_miss_rate`, `cache_misses_per_op`) plus a re-run of this window-isolated `perf record` to confirm the cost centers shrink as predicted.
