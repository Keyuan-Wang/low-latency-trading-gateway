## Phase 1: Correctness-First Baseline

### Design

Phase 1 established the first correct order book implementation.

The core storage model was:

- price levels stored in an ordered map
- each price level stored as `std::list<Order>`
- cancel and modify implemented by scanning the book

This design was simple and useful as a correctness reference, but it had two major performance costs:

- every resting order lived in a separately allocated list node
- cancel and modify required O(N) traversal

### Testing

The early benchmark suite measured seven legacy scenarios plus an overall mixed workload. The mixed workload used:

- 35% cancel
- 30% modify
- 25% limit rest
- 5% limit cross
- 5% market

### Result

Phase 1 was retained as a correctness baseline, not as a performance target. The benchmark report shows that traversal-heavy paths suffered from high cache misses and poor scaling as the book grew.

## Phase 2a: Pool Storage + Intrusive Per-Level List

### Design

Phase 2a replaced `std::list<Order>` with a pool-backed intrusive list.

The main goal was to remove per-order heap allocation and improve traversal locality while preserving price-time priority.

The storage model became:

- preallocated `std::vector<Order>` order pool
- `PriceLevel` per price level
- still O(N) cancel lookup by scanning

### Benchmark Result

At `orders=100000`, `levels=1000`, Phase 2a improved nearly every legacy scenario against Phase 1:

| Scenario | Main result |
|---|---:|
| `lmt_rest` | throughput +19% |
| `lmt_cross_shallow` | throughput +37% |
| `lmt_cross_deep` | throughput +43% |
| `mkt_sweep_deep` | throughput +45% |
| `cxl_hit` | throughput +98%, cache misses -87% |
| `cxl_miss` | throughput +92%, cache misses -91% |

### Conclusion

The pool-backed intrusive list was a clear improvement over `std::list`.

The biggest wins came from:

- eliminating allocator work on normal order insertion
- making traversal much more cache friendly

However, cancel and modify were still fundamentally O(N), so the architecture could not handle realistic cancel-heavy workloads.

## Phase 2b: O(1) Cancel Index

### Design

Phase 2b added an ID-to-order index:

```cpp
std::unordered_map<OrderId, Order*> id_to_order_;
```

Each `Order` also carried enough metadata to be removed from its intrusive level in O(1). This changed cancel from a full book scan into:

1. hash lookup by order ID
2. intrusive unlink from the owning level
3. hash erase

Modify benefited because it is implemented as cancel plus add.

### Benchmark Result

At `orders=100000`, `levels=1000`:

| Scenario | Main result |
|---|---:|
| `cxl_hit` | throughput 17K/s -> 5.8M/s |
| `cxl_miss` | throughput 8.5K/s -> 15.3M/s |
| `lmt_rest` | regressed about 38% |
| cross/market paths | regressed about 40-80% |

The overall mixed workload changed from:

| Phase | ops/s |
|---|---:|
| Phase 1 | 3,691 |
| Phase 2a | 5,033 |
| Phase 2b | 4,499,000 |

### Conclusion

The O(1) cancel index was transformative for realistic mixed workloads.

The cost was real: every add and every matched maker now pays hash-table insert/erase overhead. But the workload was cancel/modify dominated, so the O(N) -> O(1) cancel improvement dominated the regression in pure matching paths.

## Phase 2c-2e: Cancel-Index Hash Table Engineering

### Design Attempts

After Phase 2b, the next question was whether `std::unordered_map` could be replaced by a faster hash table for `id_to_order_`.

The documented attempts were:

| Phase | Cancel index |
|---|---|
| 2b | `std::unordered_map` |
| 2c | custom open addressing with tombstones |
| 2d | Robin Hood hashing with backward-shift deletion |
| 2e | `absl::flat_hash_map` |

### HFT Macro Result

The Phase 3 HFT macro benchmark became the decisive workload. On Hetzner CCX23, with 10 trials, `orders=100000`, `levels=100`:

| Phase | Macro ops/s | ns/op | CPI | cache miss/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2b | 11.0M | 91 | 0.41 | 0.87 |
| 2c | 7.8M | 128 | 0.75 | 2.50 |
| 2d | 7.8M | 129 | 0.78 | 2.23 |
| 2e | 11.9M | 84 | 0.43 | 0.97 |

### Conclusion

The custom hash tables looked plausible in isolation but regressed badly under the realistic cancel-heavy macro workload.

The main failure mode was memory behavior:

- tombstones and probe chains increased cache misses
- backward-shift deletion reduced tombstones but still paid higher CPI
- lower instruction count did not compensate for worse stalls

`absl::flat_hash_map` became the recommended cancel-index implementation.

## Phase 3: HFT Benchmark Redesign

### Motivation

The old benchmark mix was ad hoc and did not model HFT order flow well enough.

Phase 3 introduced a benchmark suite based on several workload properties:

- high cancel rate
- near-best price locality
- short order lifetime
- cancel clustering
- non-flat depth profile

### Design

The new benchmark suite split HFT behavior into micro scenarios and a macro scenario.

Micro scenarios include:

- `hft_add_near`
- `hft_add_far`
- `hft_cancel_hot`
- `hft_cancel_cold`
- `hft_modify_near`
- `hft_cxl_miss`
- `hft_market_small`
- `hft_market_large`

The macro benchmark uses a zero-intelligence style event stream:

- 45% limit add
- 48% cancel
- 5% modify
- 2% market

Timed operations are pre-generated so that measurement focuses on order-book operations instead of random parameter generation.

### Conclusion

The HFT macro benchmark became the primary decision metric.

It changed the interpretation of earlier hash-table experiments: designs that looked competitive under old or isolated benchmarks could regress sharply under realistic mixed HFT access patterns.

## Phase 4: Price-Level Storage Strategy

### Starting Point

The Phase 4 baseline is:

```cpp
std::map<price, PriceLevel>
```

wrapped behind a `SideBook` abstraction.

The important current components are:

- pool-backed intrusive order storage
- `absl::flat_hash_map<id, Order*>` cancel/modify index
- ordered price-level storage
- HFT micro and macro benchmark suite

The current `phase4a` baseline commit is:

```text
ce7e7c20bc6cb010457b7c297c3de990c08343ad
```

### Price-Range Finding

The Phase 4 report records a key correctness constraint:

- HFT micro benchmarks use predictable price ranges around `1000`
- `hft_macro` does not have a fixed price range
- best price can drift
- modify can move orders by several ticks

Therefore, a pure fixed-size `std::vector<PriceLevel>` is not a correct final design unless the workload is clamped. The report explicitly treats clamping as a workload change, not a pure engine optimization.

### Strategy

The documented Phase 4 strategy is incremental:

1. restore and validate the `std::map` baseline
2. wrap price-level storage behind `SideBook`
3. benchmark after each structural change
4. only add a hot contiguous structure if data justifies the complexity
5. keep a cold ordered path for arbitrary prices

### `absl::btree_map`

The Phase 4 strategy considered `absl::btree_map` as a possible ordered container replacement. The current direction is not to use it as the next implementation target because price-level pointer stability is a correctness constraint in the current design.

The safer baseline remains `std::map` until the ownership and cancel metadata model is changed enough that moving price-level values cannot invalidate live order metadata.

## ChunkPool Experiment

### Design Hypothesis

A later experiment tested whether per-price-level chunk storage could improve cache locality. The motivating hypothesis was:

- a single large order pool scatters orders from the same hot price level
- grouping orders into chunks owned by price levels may reduce cache misses
- different `kChunkSize` values may expose a better locality/overhead tradeoff

### Recorded Benchmark Result

The current repository keeps a 10-trial campaign under:

```text
benchmark/results/campaign_20260601_1319/
```

The overall summary compares `phase4a` against chunk sizes 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.

For the headline HFT macro scenario:

| Version | `hft_macro` ops/s |
|---|---:|
| `phase4a` | 15,958,480 |
| `master_chunk16` | 15,809,470 |
| `master_chunk32` | 15,563,010 |
| `master_chunk64` | 16,075,480 |
| `master_chunk128` | 15,425,790 |
| `master_chunk256` | 15,677,070 |

Several micro scenarios regressed relative to `phase4a`, for example:

| Scenario | Best chunk result | `phase4a` |
|---|---:|---:|
| `hft_add_near` | 21,438,083 | 23,863,634 |
| `hft_cancel_hot` | 10,706,453 | 13,167,589 |
| `hft_modify_near` | 6,430,392 | 7,622,224 |
| `hft_market_small` | 65,819,824 | 75,896,495 |

### Conclusion

The recorded results do not support adopting ChunkPool as the next baseline.

For macro HFT, the difference was close to noise. For several micro paths, the chunk design regressed. This suggests that the extra chunk bookkeeping and pointer operations were not compensated by better locality under the benchmarked workload.

The important process lesson is that the cache-miss hypothesis was not strong enough on its own. Future design work should start from profiler evidence on the actual macro workload.

## Current Track: HFT Macro Operation Profiling

### Design

The current master branch adds per-operation profiling to `hft_macro`, guarded by:

```cpp
LLMES_PROFILE_HFT_MACRO_OPS
```

The profiler separates mixed macro latency into operation classes:

- `add_rest`
- `add_cross`
- `cancel_hit`
- `cancel_miss`
- `modify_hit`
- `modify_miss`
- `market`

It records count/share, mean latency, p50/p95/p99 latency, mean cycles, and weighted contribution to total macro time.

The helper script is:

```text
benchmark/scripts/run_hft_macro_op_profile.sh
```

| market filled quantity p95 | 971.00 |
| market filled quantity p99 | 1367.00 |

### Current Interpretation

The profiling result shows that `add_rest` and `cancel_miss` dominate weighted macro time in the current measured batch.

The unexpectedly low `cancel_hit` share is itself an important finding. It suggests the benchmark's pre-generated operation stream or its live-order tracking may be drifting away from the actual book state. Before optimizing the engine based on this table, the benchmark accounting should be reviewed and made trustworthy.

### Follow-up Fix and Cloud Validation

A follow-up benchmark fix was implemented in `benchmark/src/hft/bench_hft_macro.cpp` using the same operation-mix policy (random draw with 45/48/5/2 percentages), but replacing predictive batch generation with a planning replay model:

- warmup still runs once
- two books are rebuilt from the same warmup snapshot:
  - `planning_book_` (untimed, used only in `Setup()`)
  - `book_` (timed, used only in `RunOp()`)
- each pending op is first executed on `planning_book_`
- tracking is updated from real execution outputs (`trades`, `remaining_quantity`) instead of prediction

This removes the major source of false `cancel_miss`:

- market-order maker fills are now reflected in tracking
- modify outcomes (including crossing/fully-filled cases) are reflected
- cluster cancels are validated against the planning book before enqueue

Local smoke validation (`TRIALS=1`, `BATCH_SIZE=20000`) shows:

| Operation | Share |
|---|---:|
| `add_rest` | 47.83% |
| `add_cross` | 0.44% |
| `cancel_hit` | 46.20% |
| `cancel_miss` | 0.00% |
| `modify_hit` | 3.79% |
| `modify_miss` | 0.00% |
| `market` | 1.75% |

This result supports the earlier diagnosis that high `cancel_miss` was mainly a benchmark-accounting artifact rather than an engine behavior signal.

A later cloud validation ran the repaired profiling on `phase4-finale`:

Overall:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| avg ns/op | 110.793 |
| ops/s | 9.026M |
| ok | 199977 |

Operation profile:

| Operation | Share | mean ns | p99 ns | weighted time share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `add_rest` | 47.867% | 69.848 | 160.0 | 52.977% |
| `add_cross` | 0.469% | 76.311 | 190.0 | 0.567% |
| `cancel_hit` | 46.153% | 48.459 | 70.0 | 35.438% |
| `cancel_miss` | 0.000% | 0.000 | 0.0 | 0.000% |
| `modify_hit` | 3.919% | 131.357 | 310.0 | 8.157% |
| `modify_miss` | 0.000% | 0.000 | 0.0 | 0.000% |
| `market` | 1.592% | 113.417 | 431.8 | 2.861% |

The main findings from this repaired profile are:

- `cancel_miss` and `modify_miss` are both zero, confirming that the earlier miss-heavy profile was a benchmark-accounting artifact.
- `add_rest` is the dominant measured cost center: it contributes 52.977% of total weighted macro time.
- `cancel_hit` remains important at 35.438% weighted time, but its latency is already low and tight-tailed (`mean=48.459ns`, `p99=70ns`).
- `modify_hit` is individually expensive (`mean=131.357ns`) but low-frequency, contributing 8.157% weighted time.
- `market` is not the current macro bottleneck: it contributes only 2.861% weighted time, with `market_levels_p99=1` and `market_filled_qty_p99=5`.
- The result weakens the original ChunkPool cache-locality hypothesis for macro performance. The measured workload is dominated by high-frequency resting-add fixed costs, not by deep sweeps or cancel traversal.
- From an HFT engineering perspective, the most profit-sensitive path exposed by this profile is `add_rest`, because it is both the largest weighted cost and the quote-placement path affecting FIFO queue priority.

## Phase 5: add_rest Stage Profiling (Created, Then Retired)

### Design

To move from operation-level attribution to function-level attribution inside the dominant `add_rest` path, an instrumentation feature was added behind `LLMES_PROFILE_ADD_REST_STAGES`. It wrapped each sub-stage of `add_limit_order` in a `__rdtsc()` + `steady_clock::now()` timer pair:

- `validation`
- `match`
- `pool_acquire`
- `node_init`
- `level_lookup_existing` / `level_create_new`
- `fifo_append`
- `id_index_insert`

The `get_or_create()` return type was changed to `std::pair<PriceLevel*, bool>` so the instrumentation could distinguish an existing-level lookup from a new-level creation.

### Recorded Result and Conclusion

A cloud run (commit `237820e`, batch 100000) reported each stage at roughly 139-150 cycles, with `level_lookup_existing` the cheapest at 63.89 cycles. This led to the (later overturned) conclusion that the `std::map` price-level container was not a binding constraint.

### Why It Was Retired

The production `perf record` run (next section) contradicted the stage data. The reconciliation showed the stage profiler was unreliable: the operations being timed are ~5-40 ns each, while a `__rdtsc()` + `steady_clock::now()` pair is itself tens of ns. The probe cost was comparable to or larger than the probed region, so the measurement reported mostly its own overhead and **flattened** the real spread. The evidence is internal to the stage data itself: `node_init` (a 4-field struct assignment), `fifo_append` (a 4-pointer linked-list append), and `pool_acquire` (a free-list pop) all reported ~140 cycles, which none of those operations can genuinely cost.

The conclusion was that per-sub-stage timing instrumentation is not a viable profiling method for this engine. The entire feature was removed: `add_rest_stage_profile.{hpp,cpp}`, the `order_book.cpp` and `bench_hft_macro.cpp` instrumentation, the CMake options, and `run_hft_macro_add_rest_stage_profile.sh`. The operation-level profiling path (`LLMES_PROFILE_HFT_MACRO_OPS` / `LLMES_PROFILE_HFT_MACRO_OP_PMCS`) was later removed as well, because even whole-operation inline timing/PMC attribution still changes the measured hot path and is superseded by window-isolated production `perf record`.

## Phase 5: Window-Isolated `perf record` Production Profiling

### Design

The next profiling step was a production-mode `perf record` for instruction- and function-level attribution with no instrumentation overhead. The problem is that `bench_hft_macro`'s `Setup()` is heavy and runs on every measured iteration (~5,000 seed adds, a 500,000-event warmup replay, two book rebuilds, and full batch pre-generation). A naive `perf record ./bench_hft_macro` would be dominated by that scaffolding.

The solution reuses the existing PMC enable/disable window idea via `perf record --control=fifo`. A new env-guarded helper in the runner (`benchmark_runner.cpp::PerfRecordControl`) enables sampling only around the measured `RunOp` batch; warmup, `Setup()`, and `Teardown()` run with sampling disabled. The helper is inert (zero overhead) unless the FIFO paths are provided via `LLMES_PERF_CTL_FIFO` / `LLMES_PERF_ACK_FIFO`. Driver script:

```text
benchmark/scripts/run_hft_macro_perf_record.sh
```

The profiling binary is built Release + `-g` with no `LLMES_PROFILE_*` macros, so the recorded code path is the exact production engine.

### Cloud Run

```text

```

Artifacts:

```text
benchmark/results/hft_macro_perf_record_cloud_20260601/
```

The run was clean: 40 paired enable/disable transitions, a clean 18.47M ops/s @ 54.1 ns/op (no instrumentation overhead), 30,354 samples. (`annotate_*.txt` came out empty because at `-O3` the engine is fully inlined into `RunOp`, so there is no standalone `add_limit_order` symbol; the call-graph report still gives full function-level attribution.)

### Function-Level Findings (share of all `RunOp` samples)

| Function / sub-cost | cycles % | branch-miss % |
|---|---:|---:|
| `add_limit_order` | 50.5% | 50.4% |
| ┣ `get_or_create` (`std::map`) | 17.8% | 18.9% |
| ┣ `contains` (id-index dup check) | 11.2% | 10.6% |
| ┣ `emplace` (id-index insert) | 9.9% | 9.9% |
| `cancel_order` | 29.8% | 29% |
| `modify_order` | 8.0% | 8% |

Two main findings:

1. **`id_to_order_` (`absl::flat_hash_map`) dominates the whole macro.** Summed across operations (add 21.1%, cancel 27.6%, plus modify), roughly half of all macro cycles are spent in the cancel index. The add path probes the same key twice: `contains` (duplicate guard, always misses on `add_rest`) then `emplace` (re-hashes and re-probes). The `contains` cost (~11% of cycles) is recoverable by merging into a single `lazy_emplace` / `find_or_prepare_insert`.

2. **The `std::map` level container is NOT cheap in a long run.** `get_or_create` is 35% of `add_limit_order` (17.8% of all cycles) and the single largest branch-miss source (`_Rb_tree_insert_and_rebalance` plus `lower_bound`), with `operator new` / `malloc` on level creation and `cfree` / rebalance on `erase_best`. This contradicts the stage-profiling conclusion. The contradiction is a measurement artifact (see the retired stage-profiling section), not a workload difference; the production `perf record` profile is the authoritative measurement.

Full analysis is recorded in `report/phase5_macro_profiling_plan.md`.

### Production-Evidence-Ranked Optimization Plan

An earlier draft proposed merging the add-path `contains` + `emplace` into one `lazy_emplace` call. That idea was **withdrawn**: the dup-check runs before matching and the insert runs after, so they serve two different correctness purposes and cannot be merged without changing semantics; and `absl::flat_hash_map` ignores the iterator hint, so on the (always-miss) `add_rest` path the insert re-probes from scratch regardless. Under the current id contract (arbitrary external `uint64_t` id + reject-duplicate-before-match), the hash map's ~50% is essentially irreducible.

The real lever is to **replace** the cancel-index hash map, not optimize it in place:

- **Step 1 — Replace `id_to_order_` with a generational slotmap on the order pool (largest lever).** In a real venue the exchange gateway assigns the order id, so id assignment is engine-controlled and can be made dense. The `OrderPool` is already a contiguous `std::vector<Order>` slab, so `slot_index = &order - &pool_[0]` is free. A handle packs `{generation, slot_index}`: lookup becomes one array load (no hash, no probe), the add-path dup-check disappears (slot allocation is the uniqueness check), and a per-slot generation counter rejects stale handles (ABA safety after slot reuse). `id_to_order_` is deleted; `Order.id` is kept only for trade reporting. This recovers most of the ~50% cancel-index cost. Requires: deciding whether to drop `pending_cancel_ids_` (cancel-before-insert cannot occur with engine-issued handles), mandatory generation correctness, and a `bench_hft_macro` change to track engine-returned handles.
- **Step 2 — Pooled allocator for the `std::map` price levels (safe).** Remove level create/destroy `operator new` / `malloc` / `cfree` churn while keeping pointer stability (`Order::parent_level`).
- **Step 3 — Structural price-level replacement (deferred).** Only if Step 2 leaves material `lower_bound` + rebalance cost; replacing `std::map` with `absl::btree_map` or a contiguous structure first requires an ownership-model change because value-moving containers would invalidate `Order::parent_level`.

Each step is validated with a 10-trial production PMC comparison plus a re-run of the window-isolated `perf record`.

## Phase 6a: Gateway-Owned Identity, No Hash on the Matching Hot Path

Phase 6a implements the handle refactor planned in `report/phase6_engine_handle_refactor_plan.md`. The goal is not to delete order-id lookup from the **system**, but to **relocate** it out of the single-threaded matching core so the engine hot path never pays for a hash table.

### Design

**Boundary split:**

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Exchange gateway** (out of repo / ingress) | Accept `client_order_id`, enforce duplicate-id and cancel-before-add rules, maintain `client_order_id → OrderHandle` when clients do not echo the exchange token, forward **resolved handles** to the engine on cancel/modify |
| **Matching core** (`OrderBook`) | Price-time matching only: pool-backed orders, intrusive FIFO per level, `std::map` price levels via `SideBook` |

**Matching-core API after 6a:**

- `add_limit_order(...)` still takes a business `order_id` for trade reporting; on rest it returns `AddResult::handle` (engine-issued pool slot index).
- `cancel_order(OrderHandle)` / `modify_order(OrderHandle, ...)` — no `order_id` on the cancel/modify entry points.
- Lookup is `OrderPool::resolve(handle)` → pointer into the contiguous pool (**O(1) index**, no hash probe).
- `absl::flat_hash_map` **`id_to_order_` removed** from `OrderBook`; `pending_cancel_ids_` and in-core duplicate-id checks removed with gateway-owned validation.

**Handle model (current code):** `OrderHandle = std::uint32_t` slot index into `OrderPool` (`types.hpp`). Production can later add a generation field for ABA safety when slots are reused; the performance mechanism is the slot index, not the hash map.

**Honest scope:** If cancel still arrives keyed only by arbitrary `client_order_id`, **some** component must hash or map that id — Phase 6a moves that work to the gateway (parallelizable / shardable / pipelined off the critical path). When the client echoes the exchange-issued token, the gateway can decode the handle with **no** hash lookup. The matching-core benchmark measures only the engine contract: handles are already resolved before the timed window.

### Implementation (key commits on `phase6a` / `master`)

| Commit | Change |
|---|---|
| `eaa4eb6` | Replace `id_to_order_` with `OrderPool` handles; handle-based cancel/modify |
| `0e3498d` | `bench_hft_macro` / `bench_overall`: precompute `target_handle` in `Setup()`; no id→handle map in `RunOp()` |
| `71ed912` | Trim legacy micro-benches; focus benchmark suite on HFT paths |
| `00f8f8e` | Rename `IntrusiveList` → `PriceLevel` (semantics unchanged) |

Docs: `report/phase6_benchmark_handle_migration.md`, `report/phase6_engine_handle_refactor_plan.md`.

### Benchmark contract

- `bench_hft_macro` uses deterministic dual-build: replay the same op stream in `Setup()` to capture handles, rebuild the book, then time `RunOp()` with `cancel_order(op.target_handle)` only.
- Putting `client_order_id → handle` inside `RunOp()` would **reintroduce** the hash cost into the measured path and invalidate comparisons — explicitly forbidden by the plan.

### Measured outcome

**Macro (cloud, Jun 2026):** `master` / Phase 6a vs `phase5-finale-devalidated` at `orders=100k`, `levels=100`, 10 trials — **29.3 vs 34.4 ns/op** (~17.6% faster); see `server_results/compare_master_vs_phase5_20260603_143852/`.

**Production `perf record` on `master` @ `f77e051` (window-isolated RunOp):** `server_results/hft_macro_perf_record_master_20260603_153306/SUMMARY.md`

| Operation | cycles % (Phase 6a) | cycles % (pre-handle, Phase 5 profile) |
|---|---:|---:|
| `add_limit_order` | 55.3% | ~50.5% |
| `cancel_order` | **9.1%** | **~29.8%** |
| `modify_order` | 10.7% | ~8.0% |

- **No `flat_hash_map` / `contains` / `find` on the cancel index** appears in the Phase 6a profile.
- `cancel_order` is mostly `resolve` + intrusive `erase` + pool `release`.
- Dominant remaining cost inside add: **`std::map` `get_or_create`** (~28% of all `RunOp` cycles) — the next optimization target after 6a.

### Conclusion

Phase 6a closes the Phase 5 perf-record action item (“replace cancel-index hash map”): hash-table work for cancel/modify identity is **relocated to the gateway** (or avoided via exchange-issued tokens), and the **matching hot path** uses pool-index handles only. Price-level `std::map` work remains on the hot path and is the primary lever for Phase 6b+.

**Branch tag:** `phase6a` points at this milestone (same tree as `master` at branch creation).

## Current Status

As of the current repository state:

- **`phase6a`** branch tags the gateway/handle milestone; **`master`** has advanced to Phase 7
- matching core: **no** `id_to_order_`; cancel/modify are handle-based; gateway owns id validation and id→handle mapping off the hot path
- price-level storage on `master`: `CachedSideBook` with a 16-slot hot ring buffer plus cold `std::map`
- `RingSize=16` is the current chosen configuration after a 30-trial sweep of 8/16/32/64
- intrusive per-operation HFT macro profiling (`LLMES_PROFILE_HFT_MACRO_OPS` / `LLMES_PROFILE_HFT_MACRO_OP_PMCS`) has been removed from benchmark code and scripts
- the `add_rest` stage-profiling feature was added and then **removed** as a non-viable measurement method (probe overhead dwarfed the probed region)
- window-isolated production `perf record` validated on post-handle `master` — see `server_results/hft_macro_perf_record_master_20260603_153306/`
- ChunkPool benchmark artifacts are recorded but the design is not the active baseline
- PMR price-level node pooling was tested after Phase 6a; it reduced cache misses but increased instruction count and regressed macro latency, so it is not the active direction
- Phase 7 replaces the former `std::map` hot `get_or_create` path with O(1) ring indexing while preserving a cold ordered path for arbitrary prices
- unified Phase 1–6 narrative: `report/phase_evolution_phase1_to_phase6.md`, CSV `server_results/hft_macro_cross_phase_summary_20260603.csv`

Phase 1–2a rows are O(N)-cancel bound and not comparable to 2b+ for ranking. Phase 6 uses handle-aware benchmark scope (handles resolved in `Setup()`). Phase 7 adds the hot ring / cold map price-level storage on top of the handle-based core, then a dedicated price-level pool, then header-only forced inlining for the small pool/handle helpers. See the Phase 7 section below for the full progression table.

## Phase 6b Candidate: PMR Price-Level Node Pool (Rejected)

### Design Hypothesis

After the Phase 6a handle migration, window-isolated `perf record` showed that the dominant remaining macro cost moved to `add_limit_order`, especially `std::map` price-level `get_or_create`. A natural follow-up hypothesis was that frequent `std::map` node allocation and free on price-level creation/destruction might still be hurting the hot path.

The tested implementation kept the `std::map` design and pointer stability, but changed the allocator:

- `std::map<price, PriceLevel>` became `std::pmr::map<price, PriceLevel>`
- each `SideBook` owned a fixed local buffer
- the map used `std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource` backed by a `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource`
- the intent was to avoid hot-path `new` / `delete` for map nodes without changing matching semantics

### Benchmark Result

The cloud comparison is stored under:

```text
server_results/compare_master_vs_phase6a_20260603_173405/
```

Configuration: `hft_macro`, `orders=100000`, `levels=100`, `batch_size=100000`, 10 trials, latency + PMC.

| Version | Meaning | avg ns/op | ops/s | instr/op | cache miss/op |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `phase6a` @ `d778e4f` | no PMR map experiment | 29.21 | 34.24M | 183.6 | 0.042 |
| `master` @ `7a25934` | PMR node pool for `std::map` | 31.51 | 31.80M | 218.1 | 0.033 |

PMR did improve the cache-miss metric:

- cache misses/op fell from `0.042` to `0.033` (about 21% lower)
- CPI also fell (`0.579` to `0.519`)

But the total hot-path work increased more:

- instructions/op rose from `183.6` to `218.1` (about 19% higher)
- branches/op rose from `41.36` to `47.87` (about 16% higher)
- average latency regressed from `29.21ns` to `31.51ns` (about 8% slower)

### Interpretation

This result rejects the PMR node-pool change as a Phase 6b direction. It is directionally useful, but not a win:

- PMR can reduce cache misses for the map-node allocator path.
- The extra allocator abstraction, pool-resource metadata, and control flow increase instruction count and branch count.
- The macro workload is already warm by the time the measured `RunOp` window begins.

The last point is important. In the current `hft_macro` setup, the book is seeded, then driven through a long untimed warmup (`500000` generated events in the current code), then rebuilt before the measured batch. By that point, most active price levels are likely already represented in the book. That means true price-level `new` / `delete` frequency during the measured window may be much lower than the raw `get_or_create` profile initially suggests.

This hidden factor is plausible but not worth spending a separate validation campaign on right now. Even if verified, it would only explain why allocator pooling has limited upside. The higher-potential problem is still the ordered-map operation itself: price lookup, branchy tree traversal, `try_emplace`, and RB-tree maintenance.

### Optimization Direction

The Phase 6b+ direction is therefore:

- prioritize reducing instruction count and branchy ordered-map work
- attack `get_or_create` by reducing binary/tree search and `std::map` operations
- explore a ring-buffer or indexed hot price window so common price-level access becomes index arithmetic
- keep a cold ordered path only if the design still needs arbitrary out-of-window prices

Unless new evidence shows a real production p99 memory-stall problem, future optimization work should not target cache misses as the primary objective. Cache-locality work is only justified as a side effect of a structure that also reduces instructions, not as the main design goal.

## Phase 7: Hot Ring Buffer + Cold Map Price-Level Storage

Phase 7 implements the ring-buffer direction identified after the PMR rejection. The goal is to remove branchy `std::map` lookup from the dominant near-best resting-add path while retaining correctness for arbitrary price drift in `hft_macro`.

### Design

Each side book is now:

```text
CachedSideBook<IsAsk>
├── RingBuffer<IsAsk> hot_
├── std::map<price, PriceLevel*, PriceCompare<IsAsk>> cold_
└── PriceLevelPool pool_      (Phase 7b; Phase 7a used new/delete per level)
```

Important implementation choices:

- `OrderBook` still uses the same side-book interface: `empty()`, `best_price()`, `best_level()`, `get_or_create(price)`, and `erase_best()`.
- Hot prices are addressed by directed rank from the current best: ask uses `price - best`, bid uses `best - price`.
- `RingSize` is currently 16. The physical slot index is `(anchor + rank) & (RingSize - 1)`.
- `RingBuffer` tracks live slots with `live_mask_`, and the mask type is selected at compile time through `uint_from_size<RingSize>` (`uint16_t` for the current configuration).
- `next_live_offset()` uses `std::rotr` plus `std::countr_zero` to find the next live price level after the best is drained.
- `PriceLevel` objects are pointer-stable: moving a level between hot and cold only moves the pointer, never the pointee, so `Order::parent_level` remains valid. Phase 7a held levels via `std::unique_ptr` (one `new`/`delete` per level, matching the `std::map` baseline for a fair comparison); Phase 7b replaced that with `PriceLevelPool`, a free-list pool that removes all hot-path `new`/`delete`.

The current implementation keeps a strict invariant:

```text
cold_ only contains prices outside the current hot window.
```

When the best price advances toward worse prices, `erase_best()` promotes cold entries that newly fall inside the hot window. Earlier discussion considered lazy addition / resident-cache semantics, but that direction is not currently adopted. The reason is workload evidence: the `erase_best()` / matching path is low-frequency (about 2% in the current macro mix), while strict hot-window maintenance keeps the dominant `get_or_create()` path simple and avoids duplicate same-price levels across hot and cold tiers.

### Benchmark Result: Phase 7 vs Phase 6a

Cloud run:

```text
server_results/compare_master_vs_phase6a_20260605_182321/
```

Configuration: `hft_macro`, `orders=100000`, `levels=100`, `batch_size=100000`, 10 trials.

| Version | Meaning | avg ns/op | ops/s | instr/op | branch miss/op |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `phase6a` @ `d778e4f` | handle-based core, `std::map` side book | 30.30 | 33.0M | 183.6 | 2.17 |
| `master` @ `00e6470` | hot ring + cold map | 24.26 | 41.2M | 177.3 | 1.48 |

Main result:

- latency improved by about 19.9%
- throughput improved by about 24.9%
- branch misses dropped by about 32.2%
- CPI dropped by about 15.1%

The speedup is primarily a reduction in branchy ordered-map work and pointer-chasing on the near-best add path. Cache misses rose slightly, but the instruction-path and CPI wins dominate.

### RingSize Sweep

A 30-trial sweep tested `RingSize = 8, 16, 32, 64` at a single commit:

```text
server_results/master_ring_size_sweep_trials30_20260605_185129/
```

| RingSize | avg ns/op | 95% CI | ops/s |
|---:|---:|---|---:|
| 16 | 24.091 | [23.998, 24.184] | 41.5M |
| 32 | 24.100 | [24.015, 24.186] | 41.5M |
| 64 | 24.245 | [24.145, 24.344] | 41.2M |
| 8 | 25.057 | [24.967, 25.148] | 39.9M |

Conclusion:

- `RingSize=8` is too small for the current HFT macro locality profile and is about 4% slower.
- `RingSize=16` and `RingSize=32` are statistically indistinguishable.
- `RingSize=64` shows a weak regression trend, likely due to extra instruction/codegen cost rather than cache footprint.
- `RingSize=16` is the current choice because it matches 32's performance with half the ring footprint.

### Phase 7b: PriceLevelPool

Phase 7a left one allocator cost on the hot path: each new price level was a `make_unique<PriceLevel>` (one `malloc`, freed on level removal). Phase 7b replaces this with `PriceLevelPool`, a free-list pool of pre-allocated `PriceLevel` objects. `acquire()`/`release()` are a few pointer operations; cold-map values become raw `PriceLevel*` owned by the pool.

Cloud run (`server_results/compare_master_vs_phase7a_20260606_171238/`), `hft_macro`, `orders=100000`, `levels=100`, 10 trials:

| Version | Meaning | avg ns/op | ops/s | instr/op | cache miss/op |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `phase7a` @ `da9be8c` | hot ring + cold map, `make_unique` | 23.18 | 43.1M | 177.5 | 0.041 |
| `master` @ `e8c4f29` | + `PriceLevelPool` | 21.16 | 47.3M | 153.8 | 0.033 |

Pool is about 8.7% faster, 95% CIs do not overlap. Unlike the rejected PMR experiment, this is a clean win on **both** axes: instructions dropped 13.4% **and** cache misses dropped 19.3%. PMR added an allocator-abstraction layer that raised instruction count; the pool's free-list and contiguous storage reduce both. (CPI rose 6.6% as a denominator artifact — fewer total instructions leave the expensive ones a larger fraction — but absolute cycles/op still fell 7.7%.)

A fresh window-isolated `perf record` (`server_results/hft_macro_perf_record_master_20260606_161810/`, commit `e8c4f29`) confirms the allocator block is gone: `get_or_create` fell from ~12.3% to ~9.5% of RunOp cycles and hot-path `malloc` disappeared (`PriceLevelPool::acquire` is 1.71%). The newly dominant `add_limit_order` cost centers are `match_against` (~10%), `reanchor_to` (~4.8%), and `AddResult`/`vector<Trade>` construct-destruct (~1.9%) — candidate targets for Phase 8.

### Phase 7c: Header-Only Short Helpers and Forced Inlining

After Phase 7b, perf still showed several tiny helpers as visible hot-path calls. These functions do very little work individually, but they occur on extremely high-frequency paths:

- `OrderPool::acquire()`
- `OrderPool::release()`
- `OrderPool::resolve()`
- `PriceLevelPool::acquire()`
- `PriceLevelPool::release()`

Phase 7c moved the hot short function bodies into headers and marked them with `[[gnu::always_inline]]`. The final patch also applied the attribute to other small ring/price-level helpers, but the main expected source of gain was the pool acquire/release and handle resolve functions that prior perf reports had explicitly shown were not consistently inlined.

Cloud comparison:

server_results/compare_master_vs_phase7b_20260606_184425/
```

Configuration: `hft_macro`, `orders=100000`, `levels=100`, `batch_size=100000`, 10 trials.

| Version | Meaning | avg ns/op | ops/s | instr/op | cycles/op |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `phase7b` @ `79031d5` | PriceLevelPool baseline | 21.36 | 46.8M | 153.8 | 77.7 |
| `master` @ `397e80a` | header-only pools + short-function `always_inline` | 19.33 | 51.7M | 137.1 | 71.6 |

Result:

- latency improved by about 9.5% (`21.36 -> 19.33 ns/op`)
- throughput improved by about 10.5% (`46.8M -> 51.7M ops/s`)
- instructions/op dropped by about 10.9% (`153.8 -> 137.1`)
- cycles/op dropped by about 7.9% (`77.7 -> 71.6`)

This is a large result for an inlining-only change, but it is consistent with the profile evidence: high-frequency helpers with tiny bodies are exactly where function-call overhead and missed cross-call optimization are expensive relative to useful work. The result should not be interpreted as a general endorsement of blanket `always_inline`; it worked here because the profile had already identified these helpers as visible hot-path call sites.

Build note: the first remote attempt at `0d0422f` failed because the pool `.cpp` files had been removed but were still listed in CMake. Commit `397e80a` removed those stale CMake entries and produced the successful run.

### Current Interpretation

Phase 7 validates the Phase 6b+ hypothesis: the next useful lever after handle-based identity was not allocator pooling of the ordered map, but removing ordered-map work from the near-best price-level path (Phase 7a), followed by direct level pooling (Phase 7b), and then eliminating missed inlining on tiny high-frequency pool/handle helpers (Phase 7c).

### Cross-Phase headline `hft_macro` progression

| Phase | avg ns/op | ops/s | Key change |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Phase 1 | 2170 | 0.47M | `std::list`, O(N) cancel |
| Phase 2a | 2137 | 0.47M | pool-backed intrusive list |
| Phase 2b | 48.3 | 20.7M | `unordered_map` O(1) cancel index |
| Phase 2e | 39.8 | 25.2M | `absl::flat_hash_map` (Swiss Table) |
| Phase 4a | 39.3 | 25.5M | `SideBook` abstraction |
| Phase 5 | 34.4 | 29.1M | production profiling baseline |
| Phase 6a | 30.3 | 33.0M | handle-based cancel, no in-core id hash |
| Phase 7a | 23.2 | 43.1M | hot ring buffer + cold map |
| Phase 7b | 21.2 | 47.3M | + PriceLevelPool |
| Phase 7c | 19.3 | 51.7M | + header-only/always_inline short helpers |

Phase 1 → Phase 7c: roughly `2170 -> 19.3 ns/op`, about a 112x throughput improvement on the headline macro workload. Phase 1–2a rows are O(N)-cancel bound and not comparable to 2b+ for ranking.

The next step should be a fresh production profile on Phase 7c before choosing a Phase 8 target. The Phase 7b profile remains useful for broad shape, but its pool acquire/release/resolve costs are partially superseded by Phase 7c. The older Phase 6a profile is superseded because its `std::map get_or_create` bottleneck has been structurally replaced.
